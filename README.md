## Description

This application is a Node.js command-line application that prompts the user to select between many choices on what information from the database they would like to view. Specifically, this application allows the user to view all employees in the database along with their roles and departments. Additionally, one can easily add employees, roles, and departments along with the correlating information and it will become stored in the database. An employer can also remove an employee from the database as well as updating their role within the company.
